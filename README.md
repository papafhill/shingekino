# Shingekino
A CLI tool for analyzing an application upon first approach.  The goal is to deep dive meta files and mine for useful information for security researchers and bug hunters.

## Shing-what? An Introduction
Shingeki no (進撃の) is Japanese for "Advancing / Attacking."  This tool's primary utility comes in where a researcher switches from passive to active recon.  When anyone first navigates to a website there is a response that causes the user's browser to make a bunch of GET requests for `.js` files, among other requests.  Shingekino will request these files and parse for important intel.
